# BREAKING NEWS

Lanco Flankos and Hoff 'n Goff have just reached an agreement with the league and DAZN to adjust their playoff semi-final to a 2 week matchup with exclusive broadcasting rights for the extra week being given to the pre-eminent sports network of our time. The extra week will be hosted at the Jeddah Superdome.

In unrelated news, DAZN just signed a deal to broadcast Williamsburg International FC matches next year for $1m / match. Commissioner Hilton noted he is taking a step back from executive decisions at Williamsburg International and wanted to stress "I don't see a conflict of interests here, but my mum will enjoy the higher quality streams when she tunes in."

Head of League Officiating, Clarissa Garber announced that the 5 point home-advantage will be adjusted to accommodate the 2 week playoff. "We would appreciate input from any statisticians in the league who are looking for a fun coffee break / interview practice question to work out what the new advantage should be"


## Around the League

### O-Bad-A Vibes Boys

The Efe Obada Boys crumbled to a tragically poor defeat in their Week 14 matchup against D*** Deilerson and remain the only team D*** Deilerson has beaten all season.
They renew their rivalry in the first round of the playoffs with the loser being vaulted straight to the Beer Mile Bowl.

Ladd McConkey caused a stir after last night's 1 catch performance when the question arose of whether he should be dropped for the playoffs. "I have done so much for this club. I don’t have to go everyday fighting for my position because I earned it. I’m not bigger than anyone". 

Critics noted he's been dog-shit this year and can't live off his 2024 accomplishments forever. GM Hilton stated "Everyone has been shite - wtf has Justin Jefferson done - I can't drop them all" which suggests Ladd might retain his spot by default.

### Treuily Too Late

Despite having McCaffrey (RB1) and Drake Maye (QB4) on a bye - the Treuily Washed squad went nutty this week putting up the 3rd highest score ever recorded in the Hoff-Goff-Garoffalo Society 214.04 points. Despite his team being eliminated from playoff contention with a heartbreaking 3 point loss in Week 12, the Floridian Quarterback and team captain Baker Mayfield came out then and said: 

"You will never see any player in the entire country play as hard as I will play the rest of the season and you never see someone push the rest of the team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of the season. You never see a team play harder than we will the rest of the season. God bless"

That has proved to be true as Treuily Washed put up league leading scores in their meaningless Week 13 and 14 games. GM Treuil voiced some concern over the schedule and raised some questions of why his team always has to play teams at their peak 

"wtf - we finished with the highest power rank and missed the playoffs again - you serious? Lets have a committee who ranks teams based on vibes and whether they beat Georgia or not, that has to be a fairer way to get teams into the playoffs, our vibes were top notch"

### Playoff Cherries Popped

Hoff 'n Goff had already secured their first ever trip to the playoffs in Week 12 but for Patrick Nomames and Trey Times The Charm it came down to a Week 14 play-in game to determine which squad would be the one remaining team to never participate in the Garoffalo Bowl playoffs. 

Led by Brandon Aubrey's record 24 points (a season high for any kicker), Patrick Nomames was in the driving seat from Thursday Night Football all the way through to Monday and never looked threatened. After going through a torrid run of form mid-season, Nomames ripped off a 3-1 finish to the season and go to the Waddle Arena in high spirits, hoping Josh Allen will get to play in the snow every week.

### Trouble in California

Meanwhile, some fans of Trey Times The Charm were left questioning the leadership and were aghast at comparisons to the NFL's most turgid franchise and 15 year playoff drought holder, the New York Jets. After being criticised for the lack of results, Head Coach Curran yelled "Hello, You play to win the game" and noted that the team will be set up to do just that next year with Rashee Rice's incredible keeper value after the team ate his 6 week suspension this year. 

Unfortunately Curran then went and watched the Chiefs meltdown on Sunday Night and realised its so over and we're not so back.

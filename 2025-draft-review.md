# Hoff-Goff-Garoffalo Society Draft Recap

We're just days away from the start of the season now. Caleb Williams has just figured out how to take a ball from under centre, M. Nabers is recovering from all 4 of his injuries and M. Hoffman recovering from his trip to all 4 of the replacement Orgy tents.

After a contentious but ultimately seamless (?) slow draft which League Press Secretary Edwin Butnick referred to as "necessary for the continued health of the league" and "not without its challenges but in the end a successful venture", there were some clear winners and losers from the draft and several GMs will need a long hard look at the scouting teams decisions to not listen to the Ringer fantasy pod.

With the help of guest analyst Andy Selby the team here look ahead to the season with some draft grades, courtesy of The Selbasauruses partnership with FantasyPros, as well as some highs and lows from the draft.

## You’ll Never Waddle Alone
- **Strategy:** No One Likes Us - With 3x Chiefs, Mahomes, Kelce and Pacheco (Of 2023 championship winning side Nicks Boasty) Mike has decided he doesn’t care if anyone likes us, I’ll dink and doink my way to victory whilst the refs cheer me on.
- **Coolest player:** Lamar, easy. dude is a baller
- **Lamest Moment:** Taking Brandon Aiyuk and proposing 2 IR spots ‘purely for the good of the league’, good job we saw through that
- **Draft Grade:** A

## Efe Obada Boys
- **Strategy:** Dan Campbell’s Fizzy Seeds - Easily the most stacked receiver room in the draft with Jameson Williams not even making the starting line up. Amon-Ra is the other lion in the squad as the efe obada boys went all in on the passing game this year
- **Coolest Player:** Bryce Young - 5’10 and a starting quarterback in the league, Bryce is pulling one off for all the short kings out there
- **Lamest Moment:** Finding out Ladd Mcconkey’s real name is Andrew
- **Draft Grade:** B+

## Lanco Flankos
- **Strategy:** Wide boy. Took six wide receivers in the first ten rounds, the most of any team. Will be praying Jonathon Taylor, who has missed 3 games in each of the last 3 seasons, stays healthy as one of his only 2 startable running backs.
- **Coolest player:** Picked Tyler Warren to be this years Brock Bowers. Also Tyler's hair is something else.
- **Lamest moment:** Self proclaimed Jets fan but drafted no Jets. Probably wise though.
- **Draft Grade:** B+

## Patrick Nomames
- **Strategy:** RUN THE BALL. Decided a 3 WR league merited no WRs until the 5th.
- **Coolest player:** Jeanty all day. We'll see how he'll do now he's not playing against future accountants in the Mountain West.
- **Lamest moment:** Still hasn't run his beer mile.
- **Draft Grade:** B+

## The Selbasauruses
- **Strategy:** Young, Wild and Free - The Selbabysaurs (name pending) have drafted 4 Rookies and 5 sophomores. The real concern is if Michigan Wolverine JJ McCarthy can bring himself to throw to 4th year Buckeyes Garret Wilson and Chris Olave, the senior citizens of the starters.
- **Coolest player:** Malik Nabers was the WR4 last year despite having Daniel Jones and Tommy Devito throwing to him. Magician.
- **Lamest Moment:** Wetting himself whenever a team used more than 5 minutes of their agreed upon clock
- **Draft Grade:** B-

<img width="541" height="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e950aee9-6910-4d11-926c-3a393cbab121" />

## Make Selb-a-saws Extinct Again
- **Strategy:** Wheeler dealer. Ended the season with zero keepers and ended up with Achane and FantasyPros darling Drake Maye.
- **Coolest player:** Egbuka? Golden? Blue? Bill? Loveland? Whichever rookie emerges as a league winner
- **Lamest moment:** Chose to do a slow draft (boooo)
- **Draft Grade:** B-

## Treuily Washed
- **Strategy:** I’ve always said if you’re old enough, you’re good enough - 5 of his starters are the wrong side of 30, Nicky T will be hoping they age gracefully and that Tyreek can have more Touchdowns than kids this year.
- **Coolest Player:** Is this the league's least cool team? Only Puka and Bowers have never had dial up internet but I'd probably go for Cardi B’s boyfriend, Stefon Diggs - Although Cardi I’m sure wasn’t best pleased with the baddie boat incident over the summer
- **Lamest Moment:** Moaned. A lot.
- **Draft Grade:** C

<img width="546" height="222" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d49b3121-e834-466b-a8b0-04a0604b8c5c" />

## Hoff ’n Goff
- **Strategy:** Studs and Duds - 3 Hot picks at the top of the draft and then a sea of ‘meh’ to complete the roster. HipHoff chose to draft all the players that no-one else could bring themselves to do even though they will probably score some points. Good job Marie Kondo isn’t in control of his roster or he’d be left with a thin dressing room.
- **Coolest Player:** 40 yard dash record holder Xavier Worthy even got a mention on Taylor Swift’s podcast the other day
- **Lamest Moment:** Calling Burning Man a gifting economy
- **Draft Grade:** C-

## Trey Times The Charm
- **Strategy:** The thrill is in the Chase. Drafted a whole host of players who's status was up in the air. Scary Terry hadn't signed a contract, Hunter might just play corner and Rice, Godwin, Reed all may or may not be playing week 1. This could be a boom or bust year for Trey, but gotta Chase that upside.
- **Coolest player:** Absolutely has to be Travis Hunter, Trey will be buzzing when he starts hauling in pick sixes to go with his regularly scheduled receiver points
- **Lamest moment:** Drafting Rashee Rice who's a dick. Time will tell if the suspension makes the early season a car crash.
- **Draft Grade:** D+

<img width="548" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4b85c0a-d7f0-4a38-96a5-1771163409e2" />

## D*** Deilerson
- **Strategy:** All vibes. Took Kittle in the 3rd, Bills D in the 10th. This man is a maverick. Could have kept Kittle in the 6th (took him in the 3rd) and Hubbard in the 8th (took him in the 5th) - Guess the vibes changed between the keeper selection and the draft.
- **Coolest player:** Some might say Burrow but after watching his Netflix series I'm minded to say not.
- **Lamest moment:** Also drafted a bunch of old men
- **Draft Grade:** D

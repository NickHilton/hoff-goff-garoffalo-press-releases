Following on from the tragically poor week 8 showing by my boys, with the lowest scoring RB, TE, DEF and K, I have the privilege of finally delivering on a piece of weekly low scorer content, after the consistent failure both on and off the field by the Efe Obada Boys and D*** Deilerson

Every league manager's office has at some point been contacted (badgered?) about a potential trade, and in honour of the NFL trade deadline today, this article will recap every single offer that has been sent out by Make Selb-a-saws Extinct Again and a retroactive review of whether the decision to politely pass on the studs being offered was the right one.

Looks like GM Hilton should stop sending out trade offers from a retroactive review of what could have been.

## Hoff-Goff-Garoffalo Society 2025 Schedule Release

The soccer season has just finished with the romantic story of PSG finally winning the title and only needing to spend 700m Euros on wages to do so. Who said the game has gone?

Sorry Gianni but the Club World Cup is not a real thing so the HGG Towers have just released the schedule for the upcoming season to keep sports fans engaged through the summer.

The towers confirmed this year that, unless any rules changes are adopted in the preseason AGM, the format will be unchanged from 2024.

Each team will play every team in their own division home and away and every team in the opposing division once for a 13 week regular season, as the defending champion's division, the new Afternoon Tea Division will host 3 of the 5 non-divisional games.

"We wanted to ensure divisional rivalry is at the heart of the schedule", Edwin Butnick, the league Press Secretary, stated.

"
That's why throughout the season there will be 4 divisional games every week and one non-divisional game. The exceptions will be weeks 1 and 8, where a full slate of non-divisional games will be played, week 2 which is scheduled for rivalry week and week 3 whilst we catch up from rivalry week. It's our hope that by keeping the divisions at the heart of the competition, the American's can keep up some hope of winning a few games this year for longer.
"

## Division Renaming

Despite the previously imaginative names of the "East" and "West" divisions, the league has put forward new names for the two divisions. The East will be renamed the "Afternoon Tea Division" and the West will become the "Freedom Division". The league has already announced a partnership with McVities and The Baggy Boxer Short Company as lead sponsors.



# Keeper Deep Dive
Before getting into the meaty heart of the schedule we wanted to take a look at the keeper options available this year and see how that will affect the reactions to the scedule release.

This reporter doesn't want to do everyone's homework for them, but they also don't want a FantasyPros sponsored team to win the title again, so below we've analysed the top keeper options per the current FantasyPros draft rankings.

The Efe Obada Boys will be very happy with 2 of the top 4 ranked keepers, cult hero Ladd McConkey and waiver pickup Bo Nix will no doubt be returning to see if they can not shit the bed this year in the Semi Finals.

You'll Never Waddle Alone and Treuily Awful also look well placed to make a run this year with solid keeper options.

Justin Fields trade to the Jets will leave plenty of the league disappointed in leaving him out there on the waiver wire at the end of last year.

Of course, with the draft not set, the exact value teams will be getting is to be determined so we used a mid-round estimate. With draft pick trading opening up soon after the order is confirmed, we'll likely see some moves to take full advantage of the keeper slots.

ESPN MNF will be in Los Angeles to see if Team Name`);DROP TABLE teams;-- can improve on their 1-4 record against Trey Times The Charm from last year, some would call them “TTTC’s little bitch".

## Week 8

*A full non-divisional schedule with the Freedom disition teams hosting their rivals from across the pond. Last year the Freedom (West) division went 9-19 in inter-divisional play and will need to improve on that this season, for morale of the bald eagle population if nothing else.*

## Week 10
*Baker will return for the away leg of the league's second doubleheader of the season though and will be looking to bring his original horns down energy and tame the horny VCU Ram of Brooklyn*

## Week 11
*I'm running out of particularly interesting insights by now so I'll note that 11 is the number of players on the field for a team. It's also a prime number and a sexy prime with both 5 and 17. Naughty*

## Week 12

*Some controversy here as The Selbasauruses set the random seed for the scheduling script only to take advantage of the Efe Obada Boys double bye week in week 12. Bo and Ladd will be hoping to be resting up for the Efe Obada Boys playoff run come week 12 but we've only seen GaNo Diggity's historic 2024 squad have a playoff spot wrapped up heading into week 12.*

## Week 13
*The final week of the regular season sees Hoff 'm' (maybe) Goff round out the non-divisional season with a trip to The Selbasauruses. Will they draft their own players this year? We shall see who makes the trip to South London*
